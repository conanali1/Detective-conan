    <h1 id="title1">What's an attribute?</h1>
    <p>In HTML, attributes provide additional information about an element and modify its behavior or appearance. They are placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element and usually come in a name-value pair format. </p>
    <h1>Expaination</h1>
    <p>An attribute in HTML is a descriptor that provides additional information about an HTML element, allowing you to define or modify its properties. Attributes are used to configure how an element behaves or is displayed on a webpage. They are placed within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value.

        Key Points About Attributes:
        Placement in the Element: Attributes are always specified within the opening tag of an element. For example, in the anchor element, href="https://example.com", href is the attribute and "https://example.com" is its value.
        
        Name-Value Pair: Every attribute has a name and a corresponding value. The name represents the type of attribute, while the value determines its setting. For example, in the image element, src="image.jpg", src is the attribute name, and "image.jpg" is the value that points to the source file for the image.
        
        Functionality: Attributes define various characteristics of an element, such as its appearance, behavior, or specific settings. For example, the href attribute controls the destination URL for links, while the src attribute specifies the file source for images.
        
        Syntax: Attributes are written as a name followed by an equals sign and the value enclosed in quotes. For instance, the alt attribute in an image element could be written as alt="An example image".
        
        Example:
        html
        Copy code
        &lt;a href="https://example.com" target="_blank"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;
        In this example:
        
        The element is &lt;a&gt;, which defines a hyperlink.
        The attribute href="https://example.com" specifies the URL the link should navigate to.
        The attribute target="_blank" ensures that the link will open in a new tab or window when clicked.
        Why Are Attributes Important?
        Element Configuration: Attributes are essential for specifying the behavior, appearance, and characteristics of elements. For instance, the alt attribute in an image tag provides alternative text if the image cannot be displayed.
        
        Interactivity: Some attributes, such as onclick, can trigger actions like executing JavaScript functions when the element is interacted with.
        
        Styling and Identification: Attributes like id and class are frequently used in CSS to apply styles or in JavaScript to uniquely identify and manipulate elements.
        
        In summary, attributes are fundamental in HTML as they allow developers to control how elements behave, how they are displayed, and how they interact with other elements or scripts on a webpage.</p>
        <h1>Examples</h1>
        <p>Here are some examples of HTML elements with various attributes:

            1. Anchor Tag (`&lt;a&gt;`) with `href` and `target` Attributes
            The `href` attribute specifies the link destination, and the `target` attribute determines how the link will be opened.
            
            html
            &lt;a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;
            
            Explanation: This link will open in a new tab because of the `target="_blank"` attribute.
            
            2. Image Tag (`&lt;img&gt;`) with `src`, `alt`, and `width` Attributes
            The `src` attribute defines the image source, the `alt` attribute provides alternate text, and the `width` attribute sets the image width.
            
            html
            &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery" width="300"&gt;
            
            Explanation: This will display the image "image.jpg" with a width of 300 pixels, and if the image can't be shown, the text "A beautiful scenery" will be displayed.
            
            3. Form Tag (`&lt;form&gt;`) with `action` and `method` Attributes
            The `action` attribute specifies where the form data will be sent, and the `method` attribute defines how the data will be submitted.
            
            html
            &lt;form action="submit_form.php" method="POST"&gt;
              &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;
              &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            
            Explanation: When the form is submitted, the data will be sent to `submit_form.php` using the `POST` method.
            
            4. Input Tag (`&lt;input&gt;`) with `type`, `value`, and `placeholder` Attributes
            The `type` attribute specifies the type of input, the `value` attribute defines the input's initial value, and the `placeholder` provides a hint inside the input field.
            
            html
            &lt;input type="text" value="John Doe" placeholder="Enter your name"&gt;
            
            Explanation: This input field will display "John Doe" as the default text and will show "Enter your name" as a placeholder when the field is empty.
            
            5. Button Tag (`&lt;button&gt;`) with `type` and `onclick` Attributes
            The `type` attribute defines the button's behavior, and the `onclick` attribute triggers a JavaScript function when the button is clicked.
            
            html
            &lt;button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello World!')"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
            
            Explanation: When the button is clicked, it will display an alert box with the message "Hello World!".
            
            6. Table Tag (`&lt;table&gt;`) with `border` and `cellpadding` Attributes
            The `border` attribute adds a border around the table, and the `cellpadding` attribute adds space between the cell content and its border.
            
            html
            &lt;table border="1" cellpadding="10"&gt;
              &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Cell 1&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Cell 2&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;/table&gt;
            Explanation: This will create a table with a border and 10 pixels of space inside each cell.
            
             7. Video Tag (`&lt;video&gt;`) with `controls`, `autoplay`, and `src` Attributes
            The `controls` attribute adds video controls (like play, pause), `autoplay` makes the video play automatically when loaded, and `src` defines the video file source.
            
            html
            &lt;video controls autoplay src="movie.mp4"&gt;Your browser does not support the video tag.&lt;/video&gt;
            
            Explanation: This will display a video player that plays automatically with controls.
            
            8. Link Tag (`&lt;link&gt;`) with `rel` and `href` Attributes
            The `rel` attribute defines the relationship between the current document and the linked resource, and the `href` attribute specifies the link's destination.
            
            html
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
            
            Explanation: This will link an external CSS file (`styles.css`) to the HTML document.
            
            9. Meta Tag (`&lt;meta&gt;`) with `name` and `content` Attributes
            The `name` attribute specifies the metadata type (e.g., description, keywords), and the `content` attribute provides the information associated with the metadata.
            
            html
            &lt;meta name="description" content="This is a sample webpage"&gt;
            
            Explanation: This will define the description of the webpage for search engines or browsers.
            
             10. Div Tag (`&lt;div&gt;`) with `id` and `class` Attributes
            The `id` attribute uniquely identifies an element, and the `class` attribute groups elements together for styling or scripting purposes.
            
            html
            &lt;div id="header" class="main-header"&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Website&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            
            Explanation: This `div` element has an ID of "header" and a class of "main-header", which can be used for styling or targeting with JavaScript.
