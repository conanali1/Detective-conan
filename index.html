    <p><strong>In 2023</strong>, the channel was created by <strong>Ahmed Mohamed Eltaiary</strong>(which is basically me) In that time,<br> the movie 26 was almost out as a translated version, though the owner never gave up, he went to find an unoffical translated version<br>
    And he found it! After that he posted it on the channel. Then he started posting art and other side things. </p>

    <p><strong>Later in 2024,</strong> The movie 27 was published in the cinema. So, the owner went to search for the movie in the cenima version. And he found it!<br>
    later through the year, the owner felt that there are not enough subscirbers though he works hard,<br>
     so he decided to schedule for every specific time some uestions so they can have fun!<br>
    then subscribers started increasing from that time!</p>  
    <h2 id="third-channel-logo">The third channel logo</h2>

   <p><strong>From 2024 to 2025,</strong> the owner decided to make competitions and other things though there was no enough subscribers<br>
   so the owner decided to think with a different way and he went to different conan groups and started inviting them to his group! <br>
   In addition, other than the comptitons he made he started writing cases for them! And thats the history of the <storng>"Detective Conan News"</storng>channel<br>
